# Airbnb Listings in Seattle

In this project, I've tried to look at [Airbnb listings in Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle),
with the aim of answering the following questions particularly:

- Do groups of four or more people get reasonably
  priced houses and apartments in Seattle?
- If yes, which neighbourhoods are popular among such
  groups, in terms of average monthly reviews?
- Are there neighbourhoods which are being overlooked
  but are popular and can be marketed more for such travellers?

## Approach

I've split my analysis into three main parts via Jupyter notebooks, viz:

- [A primary look at listing prices and availability](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Seattle-Airbnb/blob/master/Seattle_Airbnb.ipynb)
- [Apartment listings in Seattle](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Seattle-Airbnb/blob/master/Seattle_Apartment_Listings.ipynb)
- [House listings in Seattle](https://github.com/sukanto-m/Seattle-Airbnb/blob/master/Seattle_House_Listings.ipynb)
